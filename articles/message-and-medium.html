			<p>We can use the growing resources of electronic communication to bring the gospel message to many who have not heard. But we need to investigate the <em>message</em> and the <em>medium</em>. Because this isn’t about producing electronic tracts. That would be called <em>spam</em>. This is about <em>real</em> connections that draw us to <em>real</em> relationships that, put together, represent God’s work in this particular place, in this particular time.</p>

			<p>We can’t pretend the Internet doesn’t exist. It does; at least for those people living in developing nations. We also can’t assume that Christians have a monopoly on this new medium, as we did with past technological advances. We don’t. And thank God that Christendom is over. But between naiveté and arrogance, Christians are called to engage these new electronic tools and work that they may be used justly and effectively. </p>

			<p>We may even have something to say about how our new tools should be used for the better. But first we need to learn what it all this means for doing ministry&#8212;the same ministry that the church has always done.</p>
