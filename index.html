		<p>This is about how well the Christian church extends its authentic ministry to a generation increasingly connected to the world electronically. So you’ve heard of <strong>social media</strong> and <strong>web2.0</strong>? Let’s move beyond familiarity with the latest buzzwords. It’s time to transform virtual connections into real connections. Authentic ones.</p>

		<p><strong>Q</strong>: My church is on the web &#8230; why aren’t we reaching the masses? Why aren’t our nets full of fish? Why are you using fishing imagery?</p>

		<p>Good questions. Begin <a href="articles/net-full-of-fish">here</a>.</p>

		<p>This site is not conceived as a typical blog <em>per se</em>. Instead I hope it becomes a collection of useful articles directly related to the mission of the global/national/local church in an online generation. There is much work to do, and technology changes quickly; the articles here will be reworked and reevaluated often. If you are looking for a site that offers running commentary on current events, this is not it. Fear not, there are <em>thousands</em> of blogs engaging in just that.</p>

		<p>Instead, here you can browse for focused articles that may have some value for you and your ministry.</p>
